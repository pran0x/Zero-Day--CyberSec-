# Basics fundamentals

####  First i started to learn how to become a ethical hacker in 2024, looking for videos on the youtube, finding the roadmap.but after some days of continuous researching i have learned that it has no roadmap. I just land on the track and learn as I can.

#### At start, i learn how a computer works, ram, rom, cpu, OS. then i try to use to into window compability. 

then I learn how networks works. here are some fundamental of network

- IP/TCP

I started looking for a website, how hackers lookup it. some google advance key features make this lookup even far better.

ex: If I looking for an pdf of a book, i simply search it on google but in advance search I search it like this:

```
site:google.com filetype:pdf "Book Name"
```

```html
site:google.com filetype:pdf Penetration Testing Paperback
```
