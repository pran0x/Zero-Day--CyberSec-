we know that , every website has  a port that allows a user to Enter the website, port is like a door of a website.. common ports like :  

>  Port 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 21 (FTP), 22 (FTP share)  

IN Kali their are Several tools that allows user to know the ports and other stuffs like  :

> dig, nslookup

- How to  use it :
    - just type dig <domain name/ip> [name of the operation]
    - > i.g. dig google.com ns

Here ns is name server (ns)
